## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280"></puml>

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of theApplaunch and shut down.
* At App launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `AppointmentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Appointment` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to a `KlinixParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses, e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `KlinixParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `KlinixParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data, i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed', e.g., the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `KlinixStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Person class
The `person` class represents a patient in Klinix.

<puml src="diagrams/PersonClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Appointment Feature

#### Overview
The `addappt` command allows a user to add an appointment tied to a patient with the specified NRIC. The command requires:
- **NRIC** – Patient's NRIC in Klinix.
- **Description** – Description of the appointment.
- **Start Date** – Starting date and time of the appointment.
- **End Date** – Ending date and time of the appointment.

Here is a sequence diagram showcasing the flow of the program as well as the key steps taken.

<puml src="diagrams/AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="AddAppointmentSequenceDiagram" />

#### 1. Parsing User Input
The **`AddAppointmentCommandParser`** class is responsible for parsing user input. It uses `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting:
- **NRIC** – Identifies the patient in Klinix.
- **Description** – Details about the appointment.
- **Start Date** – Start of the appointment.
- **End Date** – End of the appointment.

During this parsing process:
- An `Appointment` instance is created to hold the appointment details.

#### 2. Executing the Command
The **`AddAppointmentCommand`** class performs the following steps to add an appointment:

1. **Retrieves Patient Information**:
   - Uses the NRIC from the parser to locate the patient.

2. **Create a new `Person` instance with the appointment added to the appointment list**:
   - Utilises patient information from the current patient (identified by the NRIC) and the new `Appointment` details.
   - Creates a new `Person` instance with patient information and `Appointment` instance.

3. **Replace the existing patient record**:
   - The new `Person` instance containing the `Appointment` replaces the existing patient record in the `Model`.

#### 3. Handling Invalid Inputs
The **`AddAppointmentCommandParser`** and **`AddAppointmentCommand`** classes enforce validation rules to ensure correct formats and scheduling logic:

- **Format Verification**:
   - **`AddAppointmentCommandParser`** checks if the date and time format follows `dd-MM-yyyy HH:mm`.
   - It checks if the date and time are valid.
   - It also ensures the **Start Date** is before or equal to the **End Date**.
   - **`AddAppointmentCommandParser`** also checks if the NRIC of the patient follows its format and if the description of the appointment follows its format.
     <br><br>

- **Conflict Checking**:
   - **`AddAppointmentCommand`** checks if the new appointment to be added overlaps with any existing appointments for the patient or other patients.
   - If there is an overlap for any of these scenarios, an error message is thrown, preventing the appointment from being created.
   - If no overlap exists, the new appointment is added to the appointment list of the patient.

### View Appointment by Date command

#### Overview
The `appton` command allows a user to view all appointments that start on that date. The command requires:
- **DATE** – Date on which the appointments start.

Here is a sequence diagram showcasing the flow of the program as well as the key steps taken.
<puml src="diagrams/ViewAppointmentByDateSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="ViewAppointmentSequenceDiagram" />

#### 1. Parsing User Input
The **`ViewAppointmentByDateParser`** class is responsible for parsing user input. It uses `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the input string, extracting:
- **DATE** – The starting date of the appointments..

- `KlinixParser` creates a new `ViewAppointmentByDateCommand` object, passing the parsed date (e.g., `10-10-2020`) as an argument

#### 2. Executing the Command
The **`ViewAppointmentsByDateCommand`** class performs the following steps to display the filtered appointments for that specific date:

1. **Command creation**:
    - `LogicManager` calls `execute()` on the `ViewAppointmentByDateCommand`.
    - The command interacts with the `Model` to update the displayed appointments for the given date (`10-10-2020`).

2. **Result handling**:
    - The `Model` confirms the update and returns a result to the command.
    - The command forwards this result back to `LogicManager`.

3. **Command cleanup**
    - The `ViewAppointmentByDateCommand` is destroyed after execution.
    - `LogicManager` returns the final result to the user.

#### 3. Handling Invalid Inputs
The **`ViewAppointmentsByDateParser`** class enforces validation rules to ensure correct formats and scheduling logic:

- **Format Verification**:
    - **`ViewAppointmentsByDateParser`** checks if the date format follows `dd-MM-yyyy`.
    - It checks if the date is valid.

## **Planned Enhancements**
1. Enhanced Search Functionality<br>
Currently, the `find` command only supports searching by patient names. In future versions, we plan to extend this functionality 
to include other fields such as NRIC, phone number, or email address. This is to accommodate scenarios where multiple patients may 
share the same or similar names, and users may prefer searching by unique identifiers.

2. Implementation of `Edit Appointment` Feature<br>
We plan to implement an edit appointment feature to allow users to modify existing appointment details such as date, time, or
description. This provides greater flexibility and reflects real-world usage where appointment changes are common.

3. Improved Time Format for User Interface Display Inputs<br>
To enhance user-friendliness, future versions of the application should feature a more intuitive date-time display format.
Instead of showing time in the 24-hour format (e.g., 13:00), the system will display it in a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation
(e.g., 1:00 PM). This change aims to improve readability and align with common user preferences, particularly for those who may 
not be familiar with the 24-hour clock. It will also help reduce confusion when viewing or managing appointment times in the user interface.

4. Currently, the `addmr` command only allows adding a medical report to a patient by NRIC. We plan to implement a feature that extends this
functionality to allow adding a medical report by index as well. This will provide users with more flexibility in how they add medical reports.

5. Currently, the `appton` command only allows viewing appointments by start date. We plan to implement a feature that extends this functionality to allow
viewing appointments by a range of dates. This will provide users with more flexibility in how they view appointments.

6. Currently, Klinix only allow users to mark appointments as visited or not visited. We plan to implement a feature that extends this functionality to allow users to
mark appointments with more statuses such as canceled, or rescheduled. This will provide users with more flexibility in how they manage appointments.

## **Appendix: Efforts**
#### Difficulty Level
Our project introduced a greater level of complexity compared to AB3, as it involved managing multiple entity types—primarily
appointments, medical reports, and medical usages—whereas AB3 focused on a single entity. This expansion significantly increased the demands on command
processing, as each new entity came with its own set of attributes and behaviors that had to be handled appropriately.
#### Challenges Faced
**Integration of Person, Medical Report, Medical Usage and Appointment Entities:** To accurately associate each appointment,
medical report and medical usages with their corresponding patient, we added an `AppointmentList` and `MedicalReport` with `MedicalUsageList`
attributes to the Person class.

**Command Implementation:** Designing commands for both entities required thoughtful planning to ensure they operated correctly and 
consistently across different use cases.

**UI Space Constraints:** Creating a user-friendly interface within the constraints of limited screen space proved to be a major challenge.
We had to strike a balance between presenting enough information and keeping the layout clean and intuitive. Through multiple design iterations, we arrived at a solution that delivers key details without overwhelming the user.


#### Effort Required
**Design and Refactoring:** Adapting the AB3 framework to support multiple entity types required careful refactoring and the creation of new class
structures.

**Command Implementation:** We developed dedicated commands for `Person`, `Appointment`, `MedicalReport` and `MedicalUsage` 
which involved building additional parser classes and command logic.

**Testing and Debugging:** To ensure the reliability of our system, we wrote comprehensive test cases to verify that each 
feature and command functioned correctly across both entity types.

#### Achievements
In conclusion, our team successfully designed and implemented key features, resolved bugs, and navigated potential integration challenges. While we initially encountered difficulties with more complex components such as appointment and medical usage management, effective collaboration allowed us to overcome these hurdles and accomplish our objectives for Klinix.
